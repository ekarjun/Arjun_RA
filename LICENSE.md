           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or

              source, and configuration files.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# Contributing License (CLA)

## Overview

This CLA relates to Your desire to submit one or more Contributions to the DevOps Exchange currently and in the future.  In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions (as defined in Section 1below)  from any person or entity to the Blue Planet DevOps Exchange there must be a Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”) on file that has been agreed to by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This CLA is for Your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Ciena and its users; it does not change your rights to use Your own Contributions for any other purpose.

## Definitions

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Ciena.  For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single “Contributor.” For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"Contribution" shall mean the resource adapters and service templates, including modifications or additions to existing resource adapters or service templates, and related code, documentation or other related works of authorship, that are intentionally submitted by You to Ciena for inclusion in the content available for download in the  Blue Planet DevOps Exchange (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Ciena or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code resource adapters and service templates that are managed by, or on behalf of, Ciena for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

## Acceptance

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to the Blue Planet DevOps Exchange.

1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this CLA, You hereby grant to Ciena and to all members of the Blue Planet DevOps Exchange  a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.
1. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this CLA, You hereby grant to Ciena and to all members of the Blue Planet DevOps Exchange  a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this CLA for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
1. Right to Grant Licenses. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If your employer(s) has (have) rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you are authorized to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Ciena, or that your employer has executed a separate corporate CLA with Ciena.
1. Original Creation. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see Section 8 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.
1. Support; Warranty Disclaimer. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support at your discretion. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. You acknowledge that Ciena and other third parties within the DevOps Exchange may provide support services relating to your Contribution or modifications thereof.   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
1. Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR  i)  LOSS OF ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED REVENUE, SAVINGS, PROFITS, COST OF CAPITAL, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF SUBSTITUTE FACILITIES OR EQUIPMENT, OR DOWNTIME COSTS OR CLAIMS OF CUSTOMERS; NOR FOR ANY ii) INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED REVENUE, SAVINGS, PROFITS,  OR  COST OF CAPITAL,    WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAD BEEN ADVISED, KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CLA OR THE USE, THE RESULTS OF USE, OR THE INABILITY TO USE A RESOURCE ADAPTER OR SERVICE TEMPLATE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION ALSO APPLIES TO A PARTY’S AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES AND LICENSORS.
1. Contributions That Are Not Your Original Creation.  Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Ciena separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third- party: [named here]".
1. Required Notifications.  You agree to notify Ciena of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
